Data Structures and Algorithms
- A data structure is simply a way to STORE data
    - Examples would include Arrays/Hash Tables/Hash Sets (most common ones to use), Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
- Algorithms are ways to INTERACT with our data
    - The goal is to create, read, edit, or delete data in a way that is useful

Where do we start?
- Arrays
- Hashing
- Linked Lists
- Recursion
- Sorting Algorithsm
- Binary Search
- Trees
- Heaps
- Tries
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming


ARRAYS
Array Metaphor

    - Imagine you are a librarian who is responsible for organizing a vast collection of books
    - You can imagine an array as a shelf on the bookshelf, each slot on the shelf holds a book
    - Just like how you can easily find a book on a specific shelf, if you know what slot it is in, you can find a specific element in an array if you know its index
